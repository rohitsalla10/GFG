                                     BUY SWEET



There are NNN sweets in the store. The cost of the ithi^{th}ith sweet is AiA_iAi​ rupees. Chef is a regular customer, so after buying the ithi^{th}ith sweet, he gets a cashback of BiB_iBi​ rupees.

Chef has RRR rupees. He is fond of all the sweets, so he wants you to calculate the maximum number of sweets he can buy. Note that he can buy the same type of sweet multiple times, as long as he has the money to do so.


EXPLANATION:

The cost of buying a sweet in this case is:
A[i]−B[i] A[i ] - B[i]
A[i]−B[i]

So what we can do is create another array of A[i]−B[i]A[i] - B[i]A[i]−B[i] and sort it in increasing order. Then for each iii, we would first check if the A[i]A[i]A[i] value of the sweet is greater than the money we have left with us. If its greater than RRR then we cannot buy that sweet and we skip to the next one otherwise we can buy the sweet iii. At this point the ithi_{th}ith​ sweet is also the cheapest sweet we can buy so we should buy as much of ithi_{th}ith​ sweet as possible. Thus we need to calculate for amount RRR, how many sweets of type iii, we can buy. We can buy sweets till RRR is greater than or equal to A[i]A[i]A[i].
sweets_count=R−B[i]A[i]−B[i] sweets\_count = \frac{R - B[i]}{A[i] - B[i]}
sweets_count=A[i]−B[i]R−B[i]​

we would add this to our answer and move on to the next sweet. Also we would reduce our RRR by sweet_count×(A[i]−B[i])sweet\_count \times (A[i]-B[i])sweet_count×(A[i]−B[i]), i.e
R=R−sweet_count×(A[i]−B[i]) R = R - sweet\_count \times (A[i]-B[i])
R=R−sweet_count×(A[i]−B[i])
TIME COMPLEXITY:

O(NlogN)O(NlogN)O(NlogN) for each test case.

    		cin>>b[i];
    	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    		v[i] = {a[i]-b[i],a[i]};
    	sort(v.begin(),v.end());

    	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    	{
    		if(v[i].second > r)
    			continue;
    		int diff = (r - (v[i].second - v[i].first))/v[i].first;
    		ans += diff;
    		r -= (diff*v[i].first);
